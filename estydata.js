Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles.\n\nWhiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won\u2019t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or beverage of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won\u2019t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to keep your drinks warm and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too.\n\nStill thinking and in need of more ideas?

Because each page is unique, your work of art will be one-of-a-kind.\n\u25ba The images are carefully designed and crafted and then printed on the old dictionary pages using a high-end printer (Epson 2200). \n\u25ba I am constantly testing to make sure that the colors, tone, and brightness of the images are correctly balanced against the print on the dictionary page\u25ba These unique prints complement almost any decor -- vintage, modern, apartment or college dorm -- and any room -- office, bedroom, bath, living room, hallway....\n\n______________________________________\nPRINT SIZE\n\u25ba Frames and mats are not included. However, the size of the dictionary pages I use are roughly 11&quot; by 8&quot;-8.25&quot;. This will fit in a mat sized for 8x10&quot; prints (which typically have openings of 7.5 x 9.5&quot;).\n______________________________________\nSHIPPING\n\u25ba Prints will be mailed in durable cardboard envelopes, stamped &quot;DO NOT BEND&quot; in red ink.\n\u25ba Prints will be shipped via USPS First Class in 2-3 business days, although I try to ship within 24 hours. They typically arrive in 2-3 days. If you want overnight shipping, let me know and I can create a custom order with which you can pay the extra amount.\n\u25ba International orders are shipped USPS First Class International. Depending on the customs protocols used in your country, arrival could take anywhere from 7 to 30 days. In order to keep my shipping costs reasonable, I do not provide tracking.\n\n______________________________________\nWHAT TO EXPECT\n\u25ba MY SHOP IS ALL ABOUT PROFESSIONALISM, PROMPT DELIVERY, AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. IN MOST CASES, YOUR ITEM WILL BE SHIPPED WITHIN 24 HOURS.\n\u25ba See my 5-star reviews here: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/your\/shops\/Lexiconograph\/reviews?ref=shop_info\n\u25ba Visit my Etsy shop here: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/Lexiconograph\n______________________________________\nMONEY-BACK GUARANTEE\n\u25ba Each print is created to exacting standards.

Your ring will have a similar look to those in the pictures - charred oak wood - but each ring is a unique piece of wood with it&#39;s own unique patterning with no two exactly alike!  Please note the variability in coloring in the photos - due to the charring process, your ring may be lighter or darker than the first image!\n\nThis is the charred wood option for this ring - if you&#39;d prefer a lighter ring, check out my natural version here: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/278011450\/\n\nAfter a Jack Daniels barrel is no longer of use to the distillery, it is sold to a number of craftsmen who make everything from planters to knife handles from the wood - or, in this case, a solid wood ring.   I purchase the barrels straight from the distillery general store and have them shipped to my doorstep, where I dismantle them into individual staves to be cut into rings.\n  \n\nEach ring is hand polished and finished with several layers of cyanoacrylate.  While many crafters use oils and waxes to finish their rings, cyanoacrylate provides a stronger bond within the wood grain, provides protection from water, and reduces the likelihood of scratching - a common issue with other finishing materials.\n\nTo order a pair of rings:  add the first ring to your cart with the correct size\/shape information, return to this page, then add another ring with the second size\/shape information.\n\nDimensions:\nRing Size:  5-13.  If you need a larger or smaller size, please inquire using the &quot;Ask a Question&quot; button in the Cart area of the page.\nWidth:  5mm-9mm\nShape:  Rounded or flat profile.  Most people find that the rounded profile is more comfortable during the initial phase of getting used to wearing your ring, but this is largely an aesthetic choice.\n\nProcessing information:  Please allow 3-5 business days to create your ring prior to shipping.  If you are in need of rush service, please contact me prior to purchase.  I can, at times, accommodate quicker processing times!\n\nAs with all wood rings, this material is less durable than a traditional metal ring, but with proper care and maintenance, it will look beautiful and last for years!\n\nSize exchanges:  We offer the first size exchange free for residents of the United States (return shipping of the original is your responsibility).

Charges vary depending on the length of the engraving and are subject to the terms of customized orders.  Contact me for further details or to set up a custom listing to do engraving work.\n\nSIZING DETAILS\nSizes are in standard US ring sizes.  The first exchange for sizing is free for US buyers.  Non-US buyers must pay additional shipping charges for exchanges due to sizing.\n\nIf you are unsure of your ring size, it is recommended to have your finger sized by a jeweler, or to try an online ring sizing guide such as findmyringsize.com\n\nCARE INSTRUCTIONS\nAvoid using acetone-based cleaners like nail polish remover as this will destroy the ring&#39;s finish.  Clean with a wet cloth or paper towel.\n\nThe finish on your wood ring may eventually scratch and need repair.  While it may sound intimidating, this process is very easy and only requires a few supplies - liquid superglue, paper towels, and sand paper or polishing grits.  For detailed step-by-step instructions, please send me a message and I would be happy to provide them!\n\nGIFT WRAPPING AND PACKAGING\nRings are placed inside of a small AMAC (transparent plastic) jewelry box (bamboo rings come in a sustainably produced cardboard box) lined with cotton.  Orders are sent with a receipt-style packing slip using 100% recycled paper inside of a brown cushioned mailing envelope made from recycled newspaper.  If you are sending this as a gift and prefer not to have the purchase details in the package, please indicate this at time of purchase.  We do not offer additional gift wrapping at this time.\n\nRETURNS\nContact must be made with me prior to returns to ensure any issues are handled prior to shipping and to alert me to look for a package.  Returned rings should be placed inside their original jewelry box and then placed into a cushioned mailing envelope (available in the shipping supplies at your local post office).  Shipping may be done via USPS First Class for locations within the US to provide a cheap option that still provides tracking information.  Canada residents are strongly encouraged to utilize shipping with tracking and insurance for your protection in the case of a lost or stolen package.\n\nDAMAGED OR LOST ITEMS DURING SHIPPING\nPlease contact me immediately if you suspect a package has been lost or misdelivered.  Make certain that you&#39;ve checked with family members and neighbors, and looked in likely spots where a package may have been left.  Call your local post office in the case of a misdelivery so that they can track down your package and correct the delivery.\n\nIf your item has been damaged during shipping, you must keep both the damaged item and packaging, be willing to take photos of the damage, and fill out forms from our insurer in order to process your replacement\/refund in a timely manner.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1458102341,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/HawkinsHandicrafts?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/073\/0\/11484887\/iusb_760x100.16085161_ex88.jpg","num_favorers":521,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/106\/0\/11484887\/isla_fullxfull.21321770_9vw36xtr.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":true,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":true,"has_unstructured_policies":true,"custom_shops_state":1}},{"listing_id":384969314,"state":"active","user_id":60059635,"category_id":68887494,"title":"Set of 4 Will You Be My Groomsman Label Rum Captain Morgan Groomsman Gift Asking Groomsmen Best Man Ideas Gift from Groom Label Stickers","description":"Ask your Groomsmen & Best Man in this unique way \u2013 with custom whiskey labels!
